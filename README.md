# Machine_Learning_Course

This repository contains the course of Machine Learning of EPFL and the two projects we had to do.

The first project is the implementation of simple methods like logistic regression to solve a problem linked to Higgs Boson.

The second project is a image segmentation project where our code had to underline road from satellite pictures.
